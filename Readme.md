# rcpp_cms_project

Sample project for rcpp cms.


clone this repo, then call `scons`, it will clone rcpp cms into a new engine directory, then you can build using build words, like: `scons bl`.


Proper explanation for the time being: https://github.com/Relintai/broken_seals (Compiling section). (I'm using the same script.)
